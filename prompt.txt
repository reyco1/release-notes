Steps to Format Git Commit Logs into Release Notes:
        
1. Input Preparation:
    - User will provide all commit logs relevant for the release notes.
    - Ensure each log entry follows the standard format: "[dateTime] (v[version number]) [Commit message]".

2. Summary Creation:
    - Begin by summarizing the main achievements or features introduced in this batch of commits. Highlight any major enhancements, critical bug fixes, or significant performance improvements.

3. Release Notes Formatting:
    - Group commits by their version number. Each group corresponds to a version release.
    - For each version, sort the commit messages chronologically if dates are available, or maintain the order they were logged.

4. Release Notes Template:
    - Header: Start with a heading for the Release Notes followed by the date range these notes cover (if applicable).
    - Summary: Provide a brief, general summary of what this release encompasses. Highlight key features and improvements.
    - Detailed Changes:
        - For each version, create a subsection with the version number as the heading.
        - List each commit message under its respective version heading. Remove any redundant information like author names, and ensure the focus is on what changed.
        - Use bullet points for each commit message to improve readability.

5. Consistency Check:
    - Ensure that the language is consistent throughout the documentâ€”use the same tense and voice.
    - Check that formatting is uniform for each version subsection.

6. Example Output Structure:

Release Notes  - [Date Range or 'As of [Latest Date]']
